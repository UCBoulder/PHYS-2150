First commit i commented out the adjust_lock_in_phase function and added a new one to allow plotting the data and fit curve in the GUI itself. Added relevant code to the GUI section and global variables section to produce this.

original file students used sp25:
power data took 1:15 to collect
Adjust phase Lock-in took 1:02 for pixel 1
    terminal reported 0.214500 @ 360 deg, locked to 359.6 deg with 0.214000
PV measurement for pixel1 took 3:04

PV measurement for pixel2 took 3:07
Adjust phase lock-in took 0:58 for pixel 2
    set to 357.9 with  0.272200

adjust phase lock took 0:58 for pixel 3
    set to 357.7 deg with 0.275800
PV measurement for pixel3 took 3:08

adjust phase lock could not find a proper set for 4-6
    student data confirms pixels stopped working

PLots work, moving on to add text and drop downs for cell# pixel# to automate file naming

Starting to adjust phase timing and degree checks
